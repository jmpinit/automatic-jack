            <blockquote style="font-size: 12px" id="name-origin"><p>I was working late in the loft one night, shaving down a chip, my arm off and the little waldo jacked straight into the stump.</p>
                <p>The waldo looks like an old audio turntable, the kind that played disc records, with the vise set up under a transparent dust cover. The arm itself is just over a centimeter long, swinging out on what would’ve been the tone arm on one of those turntables. But I don’t look at that when I’ve clipped the leads to my stump; I look at the scope, because that’s my arm there in black and white, magnification 40x. I ran a tool check and picked up the lazer. It felt a little heavy; so I scaled my weight-sensor input down to a quarter-kilo per gram and got to work. At 40x the side of the program looked like a trailer truck.</p>
